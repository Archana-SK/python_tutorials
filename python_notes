Sequences are very common type of iterables in Python. Below are the examples of Sequences in python
String's, List's and Tuple's are sequences in python.
Dictionaries, sets are iterables but not Sequences.
All Iterables are not Sequences
names = ['apple', 'google', 'yahoo', 'facebook']
cordinates = (1, 2)
words = 'Hello World!'

Sets can not be indexed

Generators are iterators, enumerate objects are iterators, zip function is an iterator, reversed() objects are iterators,

'apple' < 'animal'  Returns True because apple comes first in the dictionary before animal

'Apple' < 'apple'   Returns False because upper case 'A' comes first before lower case 'a'

when you need index, you use enumerate.
when you need to loop through two list at a time, you use zip function.

in keyword is used only for checking values in an iterable
